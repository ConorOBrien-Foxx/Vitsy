 g1+                      Gets the number of valid use declarations, adds one.
    \[..................] For loop.
      Dv                  Duplicate top item, save as temp variable.
        G                 Get the name of the referenced class. -1 will return 'vitsy1', 0 returns 'vitsy2', 1 returns 'vitsy3', as the reference goes to that instance of 'use'.

                  a{      Tack on a newline there, too.
                    Z     Output the stack - file contents.
