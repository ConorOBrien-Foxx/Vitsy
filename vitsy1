Basically, this program:


ig1+\[DvG:Za":"ZY`a{Zv1+]
i                         Pushes -1 for later use
 g1+                      Gets the number of valid use declarations, adds one.
    \[..................] For loop.
      Dv                  Duplicate top item, save as temp variable.
        G                 Get the name of the referenced class. -1 will return 'vitsy1', 0 returns 'vitsy2', 1 returns 'vitsy3', as the reference goes to that instance of 'use'.
         :                Clone the stack.
          Z               Output the entire stack - output the name, really.
           a":"Z          Concatenate a ":" and a newline on the end of that.
                Y         Remove a stack - we're now in the original stack.
                 `        Read the file with the name as specified by the entire stack - the class file.
                  a{      Tack on a newline there, too.
                    Z     Output the stack - file contents.
                     v1+  Push the variable to the stack, add one.
